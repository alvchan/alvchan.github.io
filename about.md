This is my personal website/blog/infodump/educational platform, you can find most
of my more fleshed out ideas and research here.

Me? I'm just some caveman who found his way into university as a Computer Science
student. More specifically, a first year student at Toronto Metropolitan University
(formerly known as Ryerson University).
