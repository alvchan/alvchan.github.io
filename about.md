This is my personal website/blog/infodump/educational platform, you can find most
of my more fleshed out ideas and research here.

Me? I'm just some caveman who found his way into university as a Computer Science
student. More specifically, a first year student at Toronto Metropolitan University
(formerly known as Ryerson University).

I'm personally really into weird low-level hacks, ciphers, and cybersecurity. I also
love to explore the strange and magical world of computer graphics, where my silly code
is turned into pixels and blips and flashes on the screen, forming people and places.
If that sounds interesting to you whatsoever, stick around!
